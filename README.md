In this Project , we will build and deploy a Full Stack AI SaaS Application Using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Weâ€™ll be creating a Background Removal App that allows users to upload an image. 
Then our app will process the image and remove the background using AI and then user can download the image with a transparent background.

We have built the credit system to remove the image background, and user can purchase more credits using online payment method that we have integrated in this application.

In this Full Stack AI React project we have created user authentication with the help of Clerk. Clerk allows us to create user authentication and user management with few lines code. It provides beautiful and ready to use UI components like Login Form, Registration form and user profile component that we can easily integrate in out React Application.
